h1. pcalc

pcalc is a very simple language written to help me learn Parrot, and as an example of how to write a compiler using Dhaka that targets PIR.

h2. Basic use

Right now, pcalc only evaluates simple arithmetic expressions.

h3. Syntax

Very standard formula syntax: @2*3+5@

Available operands are +, -, *, /, %. Numbers are all assumed to be floating point.

h3. Using

<pre>require "pcalc"
str = PCalcEvaluator.evaluate("2*3+5")
# str now contains a string with PIR that does that formula
File.open("temp.pir","w"){|f| f.print(str) }
`parrot temp.pir` # ==> "11"</pre>
